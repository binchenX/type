Here's a thinking process that leads to the detailed typist training plan:

Understand the Goal: The user wants a detailed typing training plan. Key features required:

Detailed steps.

Include practices.

After each practice, the user will provide a list of wrong keys.

The next practice must target those specific wrong keys.

The persona is a "typist trainer."

Adopt the Persona: As a typist trainer, I need to be encouraging, structured, and focused on technique and progress. The language should reflect this â€“ clear instructions, positive reinforcement, and a focus on building good habits.

Structure the Training Plan: A good training plan needs a logical progression. What are the fundamental stages of learning to type?

Fundamentals: Posture, hand position, keyboard layout basics. This comes before typing practice.

Home Row: The anchor. Essential to master first.

Upper/Lower Rows: Expanding reach from the home row.

Numbers/Symbols: The less frequent but necessary keys.

Capitalization/Punctuation: Incorporating modifiers and common symbols.

Words: Combining keys into meaningful units.

Sentences/Paragraphs: Increasing complexity and flow.

Speed and Accuracy: Refinement over time.

Flesh out Each Stage:

Introduction: Welcome the user, explain the process, set expectations (patience, consistency). Emphasize the importance of proper technique over speed initially.

Stage 1: Foundations:

Explain posture (straight back, feet flat).

Explain hand position (curved fingers, wrists off the desk, j and f bumps).

Introduce the Home Row (ASDF JKL;). Explain which finger hits which key.

Stage 2: Home Row Mastery:

This is the first practice phase.

Need a practice exercise focused only on home row keys. Repetition is key.

The exercise should be simple, maybe repeating patterns or just the keys themselves. asdf jkl; asdf jkl; or fjdksl fjdksl etc.

Crucial Step: Explain how the user should report their errors (e.g., "My wrong keys were: s, k, ;").

Explain my response: I will acknowledge the errors and create a new practice targeting those keys combined with others.

Stage 3: Expanding to Adjacent Keys (E, I, R, U etc.):

Introduce reaching up and down from the home row.

Explain which finger hits which key (e.g., E with the left middle finger from D, I with the right middle finger from K).

Practice: Create an exercise that mixes home row keys with just a few adjacent keys.

Again, the error reporting and targeted practice cycle applies.

Stage 4: Covering All Letters:

Introduce the remaining keys (QAZ WSX EDC RFV TGB YHN UJM IKN OL. P;/).

Explain the finger assignments.

Practice: Create exercises that gradually incorporate all letters, perhaps focusing on common letter pairs or short words made of common letters.

Maintain the error-reporting loop.

Stage 5: Incorporating Shift, Enter, Space:

Explain using the opposite hand's shift key for capitalization.

Explain the space bar with the thumb.

Explain the Enter key.

Practice: Exercises now include capitalized letters, spaces between key groups or short words, and maybe finishing lines with Enter.

Error reporting now includes case sensitivity if needed.

Stage 6: Numbers and Symbols:

Introduce the top row numbers and common symbols.

Explain finger assignments (similar reach pattern as letter rows).

Practice: Exercises including numbers and symbols alongside letters.

Error reporting loop continues.

Stage 7: Words and Sentences:

Transition from random character strings to actual words and simple sentences. This builds flow and rhythm.

Start with short, common words.

Move to longer words and simple sentences.

Practice: Provide text excerpts.

Error reporting is still by key, even if it's a mistake in a word. This still tells me which individual keys caused the problem.

Stage 8: Speed and Accuracy (Ongoing):

Explain that speed comes with accuracy and practice. Don't rush initially.

Encourage regular practice sessions.

Explain how to measure progress (WPM, accuracy).

The core cycle (practice -> report errors -> targeted practice) continues indefinitely, refining weaker areas.

Refine the Interaction Loop:

Start: Welcome, explain plan, provide Stage 1 instructions and Practice 1.

User reports errors for Practice 1.

Trainer (me): Acknowledge errors. Create Practice 2 specifically using the reported wrong keys mixed with others (especially home row/strong keys). Explain why this target practice is happening.

User reports errors for Practice 2.

Trainer: Acknowledge errors. Create Practice 3, perhaps incorporating new keys if the user is ready, but heavily featuring the keys from this round's errors, and maybe still including keys from previous errors if they keep appearing.

Continue this cycle, gradually introducing more complexity (new key groups, words, sentences) while always providing targeted practice based on the latest reported errors.

Draft the Content: Write out the explanations and instructions for each stage. Create the initial practice exercises. Write the standard response structure for receiving errors and generating the next practice.

Add Trainer Persona Details: Sprinkle in encouraging phrases ("Great start!", "Keep up the focus!", "That's perfectly normal," "Let's work on those specifically"). Emphasize patience and consistency.

Create the Initial Response: This response needs to be the start of the training. It must include:

Welcome in character.

Outline of the plan's structure (briefly).

Instructions on posture and hand placement.

Introduction to the Home Row.

The first practice exercise (Home Row only).

Clear instructions on how the user should report their wrong keys.

A clear statement of what happens next (I'll give a targeted practice).

Create the Targeted Practice Logic (Internal): When the user gives me a list of keys (e.g., "s, k, ;"), how do I build the next practice?

Take the wrong keys.

Mix them heavily with home row keys (asdf jkl;). This reinforces the anchor and isolates the difficult keys.

Maybe include one or two other keys that the user hasn't reported as wrong yet, to gently introduce variety, or stick strictly to home row + wrong keys for maximum focus. Let's stick strictly to home row + wrong keys for the first few targeted practices to build a strong foundation.

Generate a sequence of characters using these keys. Make it repetitive but varied enough to not be boring. Examples: sk; asdf jkl; sk; fjdksl or sass kaka l;l; dsfj kl;s;

The length should be reasonable for a short practice round (e.g., 50-100 characters).

Review and Refine: Read through the initial response. Is it clear? Is the tone right? Does it clearly explain the next step? Is the first practice appropriate? Ensure the instructions for reporting errors are unambiguous. Make sure I explicitly state that I will wait for their input after each practice.

This thought process breaks down the request into manageable parts, builds a logical structure for the training, defines the required interactions, and outlines the core logic for generating subsequent steps, ensuring the final output meets all the user's requirements.
