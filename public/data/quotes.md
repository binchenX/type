- What you resist, persists.
- We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.
- The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.
- Don't be overheard complaining... Not even to yourself.
- Receive without pride, let go without attachment.
- Treat whatever happens as wholly natural; not novel or hard to deal with, but familiar and easily handled.
- No man is free until he is master of himself.
- Circumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.
- Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control.
- People are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them.
- Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.
- If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favorable.
- What need is there to weep over part of life? The whole of it calls for tears.
- If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you're needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.
- To find yourself, think for yourself.
- Anyone can find the switch after the lights are on.
- The ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances.
- I fear not the man who has practiced ten thousand kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick ten thousand times.
- Any person capable of angering you becomes your master.
